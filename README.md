### About the Project
> The problem statement focuses on designing and implementing an effective rate limiting mechanism for API management to ensure fair and efficient usage of resources. The objective is to develop a system that prevents API abuse, optimizes resource allocation, and maintains high performance by applying various rate limiting strategiesâ€”Fixed Window, Sliding Window, Token Bucket, and Leaky Bucket. These strategies need to be adaptable based on parameters like request frequency, client identities, and available capacity.
